# Weather Dashboard by City

## Weather Dashboard
To create this weather dashboard, I first created the basic outline in the HTML document. I used Bootstrap to help format the HTML. After finishing the HTML outline, I started to code the JavaScript with the help of OpenWeather One Call API. To start, I created a function that assigned the IDs that I had created in my HTML document as elements in my JavaScript file. Once the elements were created, I was able to start to code the rest of the app. I used multiple functions and elements to create an app that allows a user to search either by just the city name or city name and state name and see the 5 day forecast for that city. I also created a function that allowed for the local storage to be accessed for previous weather searches. There is also a function to clear that history as well.
