# Weather Dashboard By City

## Quiz
To create this quiz, I had to first develop the main outline and add that to the main html file. After adding all the important information to my HTML file, I went and added the styling to my CSS file. After styling my code quiz, I started to add my JavaScript. This code quiz has multiple questions that quiz the user about coding and when they get a question correct, the quiz adds a point to the score. However, if the user gets a question wrong, the quiz takes away time from the timer. This quiz allows users to input their initials for their score and it keeps a list of the highscores as well.
